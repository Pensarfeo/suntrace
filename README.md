# suntrace
a single ray raytracer to track the sunlight as it reflects on thin film surfaces
If what you are looking is for a simple trasferMatrix method written in ruby look at Tmatrix/Tmatrix.rb
The raytracer is very simple and only considers reflection by looping on all objects;
Also I never had time to join the tmatrix calculation point per point with the raytracer; which is however rarely useful.
